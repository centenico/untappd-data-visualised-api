You need to be an _Untappd Insider_ to use this dashboard!

- run `yarn install` to install;
- export your data from Untappd (https://untappd.com/user/xxxx/beers) as JSON, rename the file to `beers.json` and add the file to your public folder;
- By default Untappd sets the long/lat for 'Untappd at Home' in the US, replace it with own home address by running `yarn run set-home`;
